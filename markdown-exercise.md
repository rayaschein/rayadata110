## this is my first time using markdown and i will explain my favorite show!
*Naruto is a shonan jump production that follows a young boy named **Naruto uzumaki** and the obstacles he faces on his way to becoming the lead ninja in his village.*

the three key themes of the show are as follows...
* the underdog always wins
* love and friendship is stronger than hate
* hardwork takes you farther than natural ability

*the show has a total of 720 episodes, so along the way we meet hundreds of characters*
My top 5 favorite characters are
1. Kakashi Hatake
2. Jiraya
3. Naruto Uzumaki
4. Tsunade
5. Gaara
[kakashi Hatake] (https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.reddit.com%2Fr%2FNaruto%2Fcomments%2F13j29jj%2Fmy_drawing_kakashi_hatake%2F&psig=AOvVaw1yCFbqRD5U3AuOFj9dCLtL&ust=1706893922132000&source=images&cd=vfe&opi=89978449&ved=0CBMQjRxqFwoTCIjp7cDRioQDFQAAAAAdAAAAABAR) 

keeping track of the characters can be confusing, so lists that explain each character can be really useful
