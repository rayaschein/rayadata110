## this is my first time using markdown and i will explain my favorite show!
*Naruto is a shonan jump production that follows a young boy named **Naruto uzumaki** and the obstacles he faces on his way to becoming the lead ninja in his village.*

the three key themes of the show are as follows...
* the underdog always wins
* love and friendship is stronger than hate
* hardwork takes you farther than natural ability

*the show has a total of 720 episodes, so along the way we meet hundreds of characters*
My top 5 favorite characters are
1. Kakashi Hatake
2. Jiraya
3. Naruto Uzumaki
4. Tsunade
5. Gaara

keeping track of the characters can be confusing, so lists that explain each character can be really useful
